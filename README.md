# uses Huffman's algorithm to create an optimum prefix-free code for the Roman alphabet

/* Write a C++ program which uses Huffman's algorithm to create an optimum prefix-free code for the
 * the Roman alphabet, together with ta symbol for space, using the frequencies of letters used in
 * English. Since I want everyone's code to be the same, you must use the list of
 * frequencies given in the file.

/* 1. The program should first create the code, 
   2. then prompt the user to either encode or decode
   3. In either case, the user enters the name of the file (plaintext or code) to read,
   and the name of the file to write
   4. You could, instead, write the Huffman code into a file, then read that file to either encode or decode. 
   Dr. Larmore does not recommend this.
